**What makes art... art?**

**When do machine generated outputs change from being mere graphics and become art?**

**My work explores these questions.**

**Silicon Spiral** showcases the Generative Art of Safe Hammad. Generative Art is a term generally used to mean art wholly or partly generated automatically by pre-determined rules, in my case, by a computer program. In the past I have tended to create highly geometric pieces or "mere graphics", however much of the work showcased here is biased toward what might be described as more “natural” and in some cases “organic” looking pieces, in part an attempt to discover the boundaries between graphics and art.
