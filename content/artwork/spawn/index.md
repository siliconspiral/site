I took a different tack with this piece. In the quest to find that elusive natural and organic feel in a computer generated graphic, I have worked on the basis that more complexity is better. To some extent this may be true, but I wanted to explore whether I could achieve something appealing with simplicity, and without overworking and overthinking a piece.

There's not much to be said about *Spawn*, and that's intentional! It's designed to be a simple, even a simplistic piece, with a comic like quality. In not overthinking this piece, I chose an arguably overused staple of computer artists, the so-called [Perlin Noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perlin_noise), an algorithm for producing attractive randomness. [Ken Perlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Perlin) developed this algorithm during production of the early computer animated movie [Tron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tron) in 1982.

The Perlin Noise dictates the location, size and colour of the squares placed on the canvas. Apart from some overwriting of each square several times with a bit of jitter, I resisted the temptation to fiddle too much more!
