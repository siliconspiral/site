![Ammonite](art/ammonite.png "Ammonite<br>Series 1 / Part 6")

The sixth and final part of this series was born quite simply from seeing a brass recreation of an Ammonite, the beautiful extinct spiral creature, whilst reading in a library in London. This is notably the only work in this series whose name has remained the same from start to finish. In all other cases, the emergence of a new form quite removed from the original seed has given rise to a change in name.

In previous posts I have discussed the seed of an idea for each work, that is, the seed from which the process of iterating toward a finished piece of art starts. Looking back, that seed has often been something quite basic. I have also noticed that the seed can also be categorised at two ends of a spectrum: a *concrete* shape or pattern; or an *abstract* process or theme. Here are the seeds of the art series so far:

* [Crimson Sun]({{< relref "artwork/crimson-sun/index.md" >}}): a sunflower *(concrete)*
* [Quad Crystals]({{< relref "artwork/quad-crystals/index.md" >}}): quadrilaterals radiating from the centre *(concrete)*
* [Square Wave]({{< relref "artwork/square-wave/index.md" >}}): Douglas Hofstadter's parquet deformations *(abstract)*
* [Nett]({{< relref "artwork/nett/index.md" >}}): flocking behaviour of birds *(abstract)*
* [Weave]({{< relref "artwork/weave/index.md" >}}): mouse behaviour, moving and turning repeatedly *(abstract)*
* [Ammonite]({{< relref "artwork/ammonite/index.md" >}}): seeing a beautiful brass ammonite in a London library *(concrete)*

Back to Ammonite, this was indeed born quite simply from seeing a brass recreation of an [Ammonite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammonoidea), the beautiful extinct spiral creature, whilst reading in a library. Interestingly, this is the first work in my series whose name has stayed the same from start to finish. In all other cases, the emergence of a new form quite removed from the original seed has given rise to a deserved change in name.

Ammonite is the final piece of Series 1, and therefore a good opportunity to summarise what I've learned from Series 1, some of which I've mentioned already, some of which I'm only mentioning for the first time here:

* The seed of an idea doesn't have to be complex or well formed. Start with something basic and see where it takes you.
* Iterate, iterate, iterate. And when something unexpected and interesting emerges, go with the flow.
* Randomness is key to creating novel and interesting outcomes, but I have found it best not to play heavily with it too early. I have made better progress by developing the basic structure into something interesting first, and then starting to play more with randomness in tandem.
* Similarly, colour (and sometimes lack of it) is an incredibly important aspect. In some cases it might be the most important aspect, however I have found that it is easy to get sidetracked and head down a blind alley by playing too early with colour. Again, I have made better progress by working on the basic structure for a while first before starting to play heavily with colour in tandem.
* If artwork were like cooking, then the main ingredients are: form, colour, randomness. And there is a host of seasonings that can transform a dish, such as:
  * Line thickness
  * Applying alpha to colour
  * Rounding sharp corners
  * Forming polygons where there are currently dots or lines
  * Deciding when and when not to fill polygons
