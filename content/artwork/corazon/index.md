{{< lead >}}
A new series, and a fresh start on my journey exploring where a "mere graphic" becomes art. It occurred to me that, although many of my pieces so far contain curved elements, looking more closely, I have rarely strayed from using circles or spirals to effect these curves. Perhaps a more organic, less regular curve will help to achieve a more natural feel to my pieces...?

Enter the [Bézier Curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zier_curve), a methodology for defining smooth curves that typically lack a regularity evident in circles and spirals.

The process for generating this piece was to throw a number of randomly located fixed points onto the canvas and for a line to travel from one point to the next thousands of times. Each subsequent point is chosen at random, however the closer the point, the more likely it will be chosen. The line is a Bézier Curve, and the further away the point, the more curved the line. In addition, the further away the point, the more colourful the line is from white to green to yellow to red.

I imagined a space ship wandering from star to star as I developed this piece, and hence this piece started life with the name *Interstellar*. On completion, it became clear that the final result looked somewhat like a strawberry or a heart. I chose the latter, and landed on the name *Corazón*, the Spanish word for *heart*.
