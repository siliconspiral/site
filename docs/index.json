In the past I have tended to create highly geometric pieces or \u0026ldquo;mere graphics\u0026rdquo;, however much of the work showcased here is biased toward what might be described as more “natural” and in some cases “organic” looking pieces, in part an attempt to discover the boundaries between graphics and art.\n","date":"7 January 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/about/","section":"Silicon Spiral","summary":"About","title":"About Silicon Spiral","type":"page"},{"content":" Generative Art # \u0026ldquo;Visual art, wholly or partly created using pre-determined algorithms,\nmost commonly by computer code.\u0026rdquo;\n","date":"7 January 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/","section":"Silicon Spiral","summary":"","title":"Silicon Spiral","type":"page"},{"content":"","date":"7 January 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"},{"content":"Ammonite\nSeries 1 / Part 6 The sixth and final part of this series was born quite simply from seeing a brass recreation of an Ammonite, the beautiful extinct spiral creature, whilst reading in a library in London. This is notably the only work in this series whose name has remained the same from start to finish. In all other cases, the emergence of a new form quite removed from the original seed has given rise to a change in name.\nIn previous posts I have discussed the seed of an idea for each work, that is, the seed from which the process of iterating toward a finished piece of art starts. Looking back, that seed has often been something quite basic. I have also noticed that the seed can also be categorised at two ends of a spectrum: a concrete shape or pattern; or an abstract process or theme. Here are the seeds of the art series so far:\nCrimson Sun: a sunflower (concrete) Quad Crystals: quadrilaterals radiating from the centre (concrete) Square Wave: Douglas Hofstadter\u0026rsquo;s parquet deformations (abstract) Nett: flocking behaviour of birds (abstract) Weave: mouse behaviour, moving and turning repeatedly (abstract) Ammonite: seeing a beautiful brass ammonite in a London library (concrete) Back to Ammonite, this was indeed born quite simply from seeing a brass recreation of an Ammonite, the beautiful extinct spiral creature, whilst reading in a library. Interestingly, this is the first work in my series whose name has stayed the same from start to finish. In all other cases, the emergence of a new form quite removed from the original seed has given rise to a deserved change in name.\nAmmonite is the final piece of Series 1, and therefore a good opportunity to summarise what I\u0026rsquo;ve learned from Series 1, some of which I\u0026rsquo;ve mentioned already, some of which I\u0026rsquo;m only mentioning for the first time here:\nThe seed of an idea doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to be complex or well formed. Start with something basic and see where it takes you. Iterate, iterate, iterate. And when something unexpected and interesting emerges, go with the flow. Randomness is key to creating novel and interesting outcomes, but I have found it best not to play heavily with it too early. I have made better progress by developing the basic structure into something interesting first, and then starting to play more with randomness in tandem. Similarly, colour (and sometimes lack of it) is an incredibly important aspect. In some cases it might be the most important aspect, however I have found that it is easy to get sidetracked and head down a blind alley by playing too early with colour. Again, I have made better progress by working on the basic structure for a while first before starting to play heavily with colour in tandem. If artwork were like cooking, then the main ingredients are: form, colour, randomness. And there is a host of seasonings that can transform a dish, such as: Line thickness Applying alpha to colour Rounding sharp corners Forming polygons where there are currently dots or lines Deciding when and when not to fill polygons ","date":"6 January 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/artwork/ammonite/","section":"Artwork","summary":"Series 1 / Part 6","title":"Ammonite","type":"artwork"},{"content":"","date":"6 January 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/ammonite/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Ammonite","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"6 January 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/artwork/","section":"Artwork","summary":"","title":"Artwork","type":"artwork"},{"content":"","date":"6 January 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/generative-art/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Generative Art\"","type":"tags"},{"content":"Weave\nSeries 1 / Part 5 \u0026ldquo;The fifth part of this series is an example of unexpected properties emerging with each attempt to develop the piece further. I wanted to toy with the idea of autonomous elements moving around the canvas. In this case, I set off a single element which followed a two step process again and again. I called this element a “mouse”, and in fact, the piece was originally called Whiskers rather than Weave.\u0026rdquo; For me, the mechanism by which a blank canvas is transformed into passable art is through iterative development and embracing unexpected deviation with each iteration. In art, and in other disciplines, the phenomenon whereby unexpected outcomes become apparent is called Emergence. Increasingly complex behaviours in a system lead to complex interactions which in turn produce unpredictable results, so called Emergent Properties. As you might imagine, this is particularly prevalent in generative art where the ability to layer more and more behaviour in code with great ease enables the coder cum artist to introduce complexity, in turn leading to hopefully desirable emergent properties.\nSo what does this mean in practice? I don\u0026rsquo;t think about the process consciously, but having given some it thought, with each iteration it involves the following:\nStop and look at the current state of the art and think about what has changed from the previous iteration. What do you like? What don\u0026rsquo;t you like? The change from a previous iteration is often unexpected i.e. emergent and will sometimes produce a visceral reaction, positive or negative.\nAdd a small amount of code to do one or more of the following:\nBuild upon what you like by adjusting and improve it, particularly if you just added it. Fix or remove what you don\u0026rsquo;t like, particularly if you just added it. Conceive of, and implement, new additions which will complement what you see. Rerun the code. Often the change won\u0026rsquo;t quite be what you intended.\nReturn to step 1.\nN.B. I think it\u0026rsquo;s important not to overthink the changes you want to make before trying to faithfully recreate them. Experimentation and \u0026ldquo;failure\u0026rdquo; is key. Thinking \u0026ldquo;that should roughly give me what I want\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;let\u0026rsquo;s see what happens if I tweak this number a bit\u0026rdquo; can lead to good results.\nThe piece that\u0026rsquo;s missing from this process is how to come up with that initial idea, or seed, from which to start iterating. I hope to cover that in the final part of this series for the piece ammonite.\nBack to Weave, this was a great example of unexpected properties emerging with each iteration. Similar to what I did with Nett, I wanted again to toy with the idea of autonomous elements moving around the canvas. In this case, I set off a single element which followed a two step process again and again. I called this element a \u0026ldquo;mouse\u0026rdquo;, and in fact, the piece was originally called Whiskers rather than Weave. This is the process:\nMove in a straight line for a random distance favouring stopping on a set grid of points on the canvas.\nChange direction to one of the eight points of the compass.\nApart from making sure the mouse didn\u0026rsquo;t leave the canvas, that was it. The result was as follows:\nWhiskers Now I really like this, and hope to revisit it one day, but by accident, I left the programme running longer than usual to make a cup of tea, and the following emerged:\nWeave Original It looked like a basket weave and I thought I\u0026rsquo;d run with that. I then added a textured purple background to complement the yellow / orange / gold in the image. Purple also added a sense of royalty to the golden pattern. At this point, I felt the edges looked very regular and though about how I could make them look more natural, so I frayed them a little by having the \u0026ldquo;mouse\u0026rdquo; simply turn back on itself when it reached the edge of the weave to give the final product.\n","date":"21 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/artwork/weave/","section":"Artwork","summary":"Series 1 / Part 5","title":"Weave","type":"artwork"},{"content":"","date":"21 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/weave/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Weave","type":"tags"},{"content":"Nett\nSeries1 / Part 4 This is the fourth piece in this series. As usual, I started with a small seed of an idea and grew things from there. In this case, I started with a simulation of the flocking of birds! Over past years, I\u0026rsquo;ve enjoyed writing a few graphical programs that simulate the behaviour and motion of a flock of birds which follow a lead bird whilst at the same time keeping their distance from each other. The end result is a natural and attractive swarming of dots, which led to this piece. For a better idea of flocking algorithms, have a look at this classic Artificial Life program called Boids. In starting with a simulation, I wanted to depart a little from my artworks to date which more explicitly draw from equations, and I liked the idea of simply giving a bunch of dots a few simple rules, letting them loose, and seeing if art comes out at the other end!\nMy birds are very simple. I lined them up in a regular grid then placed a bunch of fixed invisible \u0026ldquo;magnets\u0026rdquo; randomly on the screen. The birds are attracted to every magnet in equal measure which causes them to accelerate and move. The birds make no attempt to keep away from each other. I also modelled a bit of drag slowing the birds down as though there were air friction.\nThe program steps through time, frame by frame, and in each frame the acceleration is calculated, drag is applied, a new velocity calculated, and the bird is moved.\nMy first output yielded a bunch of dots which, although had some character, still needed a lot of work to get to something a bit more interesting and fleshed out:\nJust Dots I then thought about \u0026ldquo;joining the dots\u0026rdquo; to see what that would look like:\nJust a Net In joining the dots, I felt as though I was folding a tangible structure like a fishing net, or a napkin. With this in mind, and playing with variations of colour, I ended up with the final result. It occurred to me that, rather than looking like a flock of birds, it has more of an organic fleshy feel like a colourful sea creature such as the Red Cushion Starfish:\nRed Cushion Starfish I mentioned that the image is built up by stepping through time, frame by frame, as the birds move toward the magnets. Here is a video demonstrating that:\nYour browser does not support the video tag. Finally, why the name Nett? At some point the piece started to look like a fishing net. So why the odd spelling? As I was finishing this work, I was on family holiday in a beautiful part of Bavaria in Germany. The German language has the word nett which means nice, which I felt was a fitting name for this piece.\n","date":"2 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/artwork/nett/","section":"Artwork","summary":"Series 1 / Part 4","title":"Nett","type":"artwork"},{"content":"","date":"2 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/nett/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Nett","type":"tags"},{"content":"Square Wave\nSeries 1 / Part 3 This is the third piece in this series. Square Wave was born after I finally read the book Metamagical Themas, an assorted assembly of articles written for the magazine Scientific American by the cognitive scientist, computer scientist, and polymath, Douglas Hofstadter. One of his articles from July 1983 is titled \u0026ldquo;Parquet Deformations: A Subtle, Intricate Art Form\u0026rdquo; where he asks about the difference between music and visual art and discusses the idea of trying to capture the essence of the musical experience in visual form. As Hofstadter explains, a parquet is a regular mosaic made of inlaid wood, and the Parquet Deformations he refers to are artwork displaying a gradual change and progression in the shape of these mosaics over time. I believe the examples he offers can quite clearly be placed in the camp of generative art. One example I singled out is called \u0026ldquo;I at the Center\u0026rdquo; by David Oleson:\nI at the Center You\u0026rsquo;ll notice in this image that the proverbial letter \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rdquo; at the centre of the image is perfect but becomes more deformed as your eye moves toward the edges, where each edge has its own unique deformation. I considered how I might replicate this in code and logically felt I should start with the \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rdquo; at the centre and work outward. As you can see from the resulting piece, I quickly and happily deviated from my task again and again, both in form and in colour, until I was happy with the result. Iterative development and embracing unexpected deviation in each iteration is a common theme in generative art practice, and one that I plan to expand on in a future part of this series.\n","date":"19 October 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/artwork/square-wave/","section":"Artwork","summary":"Series 1 / Part 3","title":"Square Wave","type":"artwork"},{"content":"","date":"19 October 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/square-wave/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Square Wave","type":"tags"},{"content":"Quad Crystals\nSeries 1 / Part 2 \u0026ldquo;This is the second piece my first art series. I began by drawing a set of quadrilaterals radiating out from the centre, and in fact, the piece started off life being called Quad Ray, but as the piece developed, the quads look less like rays emanating from the centre, and more like crystals.\u0026rdquo; Of interest, I\u0026rsquo;ve used two different sources of (pseudo)random numbers for this piece\u0026hellip;\nFirstly, I\u0026rsquo;ve employed the Halton Sequence which I also used for Crimson Sun. Here it is used to generate the locations and dimensions of the quads, and from those, to derive the basic colour of each quad.\nSecondly, I\u0026rsquo;ve sourced random numbers from a Gaussian distribution, also known as a normal distribution. Random numbers drawn from the normal distribution, when plotted on a graph, follow a so-called and familiar Bell Curve whereby numbers drawn are most likely gathered around the centre of the graph, and the likelihood of a number being drawn tails off the further away it is from the centre:\nBell Curve The normal distribution is commonly found in nature. For example, if you were to plot people\u0026rsquo;s heights, or their blood pressures, or their IQ, you will find that they follow a normal distribution.\nThis piece uses random numbers from a normal distribution to \u0026ldquo;jitter\u0026rdquo; the quads i.e. to redraw each quad with a slight variation in its coordinates. The jitter is used to soften the edges of the quads to make them look a little natural and perhaps almost hand drawn.\n","date":"7 October 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/artwork/quad-crystals/","section":"Artwork","summary":"Series 1 / Part 2","title":"Quad Crystals","type":"artwork"},{"content":"","date":"7 October 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/quad-crystals/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Quad Crystals","type":"tags"},{"content":"Crimson Sun\nSeries 1 / Part 1 \u0026ldquo;This is the first piece of artwork in my first art series. The initial seed of the idea was a sunflower rather than a sun. I had planned to create a circle and fill it with triangles which would represent the sunflower\u0026rsquo;s seeds and see where that took me, but very quickly, especially as I started to colour the output in reddish tones, I realised that it looked less like a sunflower and more like a sun.\u0026rdquo; An interesting aspect of this work is the not-so-random placement and dimensions of the numerous triangles. A common strategy for this would be to use random number generation, however I wanted the placement to be much more homogeneous. Enter the Halton Sequence, a deterministic sequence which appears random for most purposes, however the generated numbers are well distributed as they progress.\nThe Halton Sequence requires seeding with an integer \u0026ldquo;base\u0026rdquo; from which to start. Each base will result in a different sequence, much like seeding a random number generator. For example, base 2 results in the following sequence:\n1⁄2, 1⁄4, 3⁄4, 1⁄8, 5⁄8, 3⁄8, 7⁄8, 1⁄16, 9⁄16, 5/16, 13/16, 3/16, 11/16, ... And base 3 results in the following:\n1/3, 2/3, 1/9, 4/9, 7/9, 2/9, 5/9, 8/9, 1/27, 10/27, 19/27, 4/27, 13/27, 22/27, 7/27, ... Hopefully this gives a little insight into the algorithm which underlies this piece.\n","date":"27 September 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/artwork/crimson-sun/","section":"Artwork","summary":"Series 1 / Part 1","title":"Crimson Sun","type":"artwork"},{"content":"","date":"27 September 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/crimson-sun/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Crimson Sun","type":"tags"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories","type":"categories"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"}]
